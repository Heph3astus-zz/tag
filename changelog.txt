ok this is turning into a genuine project so I should *probably* have a changelog. here is is

V 1.2 (Hep3astus):
  Actually added the capturing mechanism. The nets were too bad at the game to have it happen but then I realized it was very broken
  Did some other changes that I don't remember


V 1.13 (Heph3astus):
  added a punishment to the hunter for staying still
    This should promote more exploration and stop it from just staying in one place collecting points from players nearby

V 1.12 (Heph3astus):
  changed colour of collision dots
  fixed collision system

V 1.11 (Heph3astus):
  created a bandaid solution for an index out of range error that I'm still not sure the cause of
    Will remove and update once I find the issue

V 1.1 (Heph3astus):

  Redid the collision system for players and hunters to use the raycaster
    the other one was being extremely sensitive and blocking lots of movement
    Also added the ability to not display anything with the raycaster
      otherwise would have shifted doubles of the rays
    removed accidental duplication of execution of functions by players and hunters
        meant that all functions were going twice as much distance as expected

V 1.0 (not really but its when I'm staring this) (By Heph3astus):
  Bug fixes of course

  Added a system to change counts of layers and changed filenames to reflect that
    This should let me and anyone else experiment with what layer counts work best
      Yes I could try to implement NEAT but I don't have the skills for that.
        If someone wants to please do and push it but not to master cuz yea...

  Removed getWeights function as it had no use because I put the writing of the network into the network class

  Got rid of useless template which was just for me to remember how to code it

  Fixed bug that was occasionally throwing permission errors for creating a file
    Added relpath to all file grabs because some computers didn't like it

  Fixed how player fitness is calculated.
    The loss was calculated poorly and was accidentally adding instead of subtracting
      Made less important because its every frame

  Added general options to help hopefully ramp up training speed like easy change to frame count of sim

  Fixed fact that output floats were way higher or lower than the biases
    Changed normal distribution shuffle variance to reflect this
    removed the output bias caps

  Added titles to files cuz people might somehow be confused

  Added more rays to the players and hunters so that they can more easily see things (32 rays vs 16)

  Created readme file

  Added this changelog
