ok this is turning into a genuine project so I should *probably* have a changelog. here is is


V 1.0 (not really but its when I'm staring this) (By Heph3astus):
  Bug fixes of course

  Added a system to change counts of layers and changed filenames to reflect that
    This should let me and anyone else experiment with what layer counts work best
      Yes I could try to implement NEAT but I don't have the skills for that.
        If someone wants to please do and push it but not to master cuz yea...

  Removed getWeights function as it had no use because I put the writing of the network into the network class

  Got rid of useless template which was just for me to remember how to code it

  Fixed bug that was occasionally throwing permission errors for creating a file
    Added relpath to all file grabs because some computers didn't like it

  Fixed how player fitness is calculated.
    The loss was calculated poorly and was accidentally adding instead of subtracting
      Made less important because its every frame

  Added general options to help hopefully ramp up training speed like easy change to frame count of sim

  Fixed fact that output floats were way higher or lower than the biases
    Changed normal distribution shuffle variance to reflect this
    removed the output bias caps

  Added titles to files cuz people might somehow be confused

  Added more rays to the players and hunters so that they can more easily see things (32 rays vs 16)

  Created readme file

  Added this changelog
